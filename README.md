# CanMan
Student MidTerm project, CanMan, a 2d paint puzzle platformer made in Unity. 
Play as CanMan and solve puzzles to reach the end of each level and use the POWER OF PAINT to make your way through the levels. 

Only some files included, this game is currently being worked on and updated to be shipped in the near future.
Asking me for insight is okay, providing code and materials are a no-go.
